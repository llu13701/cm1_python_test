<h3>Django Test Instruction</h3>

Hi there! You are going to make edits on a Django project. The Django project is a super simple version of Reddit. Note that the repo uses terminology that differs from Reddit terminology. Clone this repo (https://github.com/nikolak/django_reddit) and complete the following tasks:

1. Make it work.
   There are a couple bugs in the repo. Depending on your version, bugs are very likely to occur. We expect you to fix these bugs and make the original code run.
   <u> Deliverables:</u> Make a post with your full name and the date (Jul 04, 2023) or (MMM DD, YYYY) format and send over the screenshot.

2. For submissions that have URL, the code will automatically direct you to the URL rather than the submissions detail page. We are going to change it. When a user clicks on the submission/post from the home page, it will direct them to the detailed submission page (please find the right views.py function). If a submission has a URL, we will just display the URL as an additional line instead.
   <u> Deliverables:</u> You are going to make two posts, one with a URL and the other one without URL and send over the screenshot.

3. Let's add some additional information: submissions and comments on the user profile.
   <u> Deliverables:</u>: Make a couple of posts after registering yourself and take a screenshot of your profile with the list of comments and submissions.

4. Let's add an "Edit" button on the comment page that allows the right user to edit his own submissions.
   <u> Deliverables: </u>: Take two screenshots of the new comments page with the functioning "edit" bottom. First screenshot shows the submission and the second screenshot shows the SAME submission (with the same ID) but with edited content.

   Before:

5. Finally, please upload a youtube or loom video going over a live demo with the above tasks.
